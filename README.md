todo list:<br> 
(1) descriptors generation <br> 
(2) kmeans cluserting to generate vocabulary (mean of each cluster) <--  we are now here. <br> 
(3) generate histogramme for each image in the base, save the histogrammes <br> 
(4) given a new test image, calculate hist, compare it to all the hists in the base <br> 
(5) get the ranking of closest hist <br>
